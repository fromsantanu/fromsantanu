# Hi, I'm Santanu Karmakar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology specialist interested in Health Data Science. These repositories have been created mainly for those who want to learn subjects associated with health data science. Here, we have three categories:

- **Foundational Knowledge**: This category deals with foundational knowledge like Python, R, SQL, etc.
- **Domain-Specific Methods and Techniques**: In this category, solutions exists that answer specific questions related to health datascience.
- **Complete Case Studies**: This section provides a list of solutions that aim to solve a single, larger problem.

-->

### Domain specific Methods & Techniques
- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/EDA-Main) : It consists of python scripts of exploratory data analysis on various examples like disease and health infrastructure.
- [Descriptive Statistics (DST)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/STM-Main) : This category includes problems of descriptive statistics. This will liclude problems of central tendency and dispersion.
<!--
- [Inferential Statistics (IST) (Currently disabled)](#) : This category includes problems of inferential statistics. This will include problems dealing with populations and samples,estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals etc.
- [Behavioral Health Analytics (BHA) (Currently disabled)](#) : Explore the impact of behavioral factors such as smoking, diet, sleep, exercise and stress on health outcomes.
- [Geospatial Analysis of Disease Spread (GADS) (Currently disabled)](#) : Analyze and visualize the geographic distribution of diseases using GIS tools and dealing with maps and coordinates.
- [Infectious Disease Modeling (IDM) (Comming soon) (Currently disabled)](#) : It will include python scripts for different disease tracking models like SIR, SIER, SIS etc. with examples of disease like Covid, Dengue, TB etc.
- [Non-infectious Disease Modeling (NIDM) (Currently disabled)](#) : Develop Agent-Based Models to understand the spread of diseases in a population by simulating the interactions of individuals.
- [Bio-Statistical Analysis (BSA) (Currently disabled)](#) : Implementing Time-Series Analysis, Clinical Trial Data Analysis, Survival Analysis, Causal Analysis etc using Python and R.
- [Data engineering (DEM) (Currently disabled)](#) : These will be a collection of python and SQL scripts extraction, scrapping, cleaning, transfomation and validation of data.
