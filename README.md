# Hi, I'm Santanu Karmakar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology specialist specializing in Health Data Science. I love working on projects related to Epidemiology and Bio Statistics. Presently I teach Python and Java programming language. I also mentor my students do develop programs for various projects and professionally prepare for facing the real responsibilities.

## Key Projects
- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/EDA-Main) : It consists of python scripts of exploratory data analysis on various examples like disease and health infrastructure.
- [Data engineering (Pre processing scripts)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : These will be a collection of python and SQL scripts extraction, scrapping, cleaning, transfomation and validation of data.
- [Geospatial Analysis of Disease Spread](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Analyze and visualize the geographic distribution of diseases using GIS tools.

- [Infectious Disease Modeling](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : It will include python scripts for different disease tracking models like SIR, SIER, SIS etc. with examples of disease like Covid, Dengue, TB etc.
- [Non-infectious Disease Modeling](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Develop Agent-Based Models to understand the spread of diseases in a population by simulating the interactions of individuals.
- [Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Use machine learning models to predict the likelihood of disease outbreaks based on historical and environmental data.
- [Behavioral Health Analytics](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Explore the impact of behavioral factors such as smoking, diet, and exercise on health outcomes.
- [Modeling Health Behavior Changes](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Develop models to predict or influence changes in health behaviors within populations.
