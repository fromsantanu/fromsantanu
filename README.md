## Introduction 
I'm a technology specialist interested in Health Data Science. These repositories have been created primarily for those who want to learn subjects associated with health data science. **We particularly aim to teach methods for researching, analyzing, and concluding on various problems related to healthcare practice**. Our main focus lies in the processes of **interpreting data, analyzing charts, drawing statistical inferences, and learning to make informed decisions**. Additionally, we want to explore methods of prediction. Therefore, we have organized the content into three categories:

- **Foundational Knowledge**: This category deals with foundational knowledge like Python, R, statistics, public health, developmental studies, public policies etc.
- **Case Studies on Healthcare and Epidemiology**: In this category, solutions exists that answer specific questions related to health datascience.
- **Research Analysis and Reviews**: This section reviews existing researches and reports. Here we do our own analysis with data extracted from real sources.

- [**Basic R Programming (BRP)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BRP-Main/blob/main/README.md):  The scope includes basic R programming with the intention of solving statistical problems. There are two main sections. The first part covers basic R knowledge to solve statistical problems, while the second part focuses on the use of prominent packages commonly used in R.
- [**QBasic Programming for Budding Programmers (School Level)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/QBasic-Programming/blob/main/README.md): This tutorial introduces QBasic programming to school-level students, focusing on fundamental concepts like variables, loops, and conditional statements. It provides hands-on exercises to build problem-solving skills and foster an interest in coding through simple, engaging examples particularly for those in grades VI to VIII.

- [**Public Health and Epidemiology (PHE)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/PHE-Main) : Public health aims to protect and improve population health through prevention, education, and promoting healthy lifestyles. Epidemiology, a key discipline within public health, studies the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in populations, providing critical insights for the development and implementation of effective public health interventions.
- [**Introduction to Research Methods (IRM)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/IRM-Main) : Here, we have tried to include sections on common research methods related to the healthcare domain. Healthcare heavily depends on new findings contributed by research and studies on existing methods of treatment and their efficacies. Hence, we consider the ability to conduct research to be fundamental to healthcare studies.
- [**Basic Statistics for Research (BSR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BSR-Main) : In this section we have covered the basic techniques of statistics relevant to research and investigation. Please note we have not gone into the theoretical part, rather we focused on their fitment in different situations and various ways they can be performed using Python and R programming language both.
- [**Basic ReactJS Foundation Tutorial**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/React-Tutorial/blob/main/README.md) : This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to ReactJS, covering core concepts like components, state, props, and JSX. It also delves into building dynamic user interfaces, handling events, and integrating routing and state management for modern web applications.
- [**MySQL with XAMPP - Tutorial**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/MySQL-Tutorial/blob/main/README.md): This tutorial covers the fundamentals of SQL using MySQL with XAMPP, guiding learners through database creation, querying, and management. It also explores advanced concepts like joins, stored procedures, and performance optimization, with real-world applications and deployment strategies.
- [**Developing Applications with ChatGPT**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/ChatGPTDev-Tutorial/blob/main/README.md): In this tutorial, we teach how one should approach develping software projects with ChatGPT. THe projects uses Web features and Databases. The technology discussed here involves React Jas for front end development and Python Flask and MySql for backend processes.

### Case Studies on Healthcare and Epideiology
- [**Cases of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/EDA-Main) : Includes basic charting methods like line chart, bar chart, histogram, pie chart and scatter charts. It also include the methods of data cleaning and preparation etc.
- [**Uses of Descriptive Statistics (DST)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/DST-Main) : The scope includes application of mean, medean and mode, varience, covarience, standard deviation, and concept of quartiles and quantiles.
- [**Application of Inferential Statistics (IST)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/IST-Main) : The scope include advanced charting with probaility distributions, hypothesis tesing, regression options, ANOVA testing etc.
- [**Public Health in India (PHIN)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/PHI-Main) :The section "Public Health in India" focuses on how India is improving healthcare infrastructure, combating diseases, promoting wellness, and addressing health disparities across diverse populations.
- [**Public Health in United Kingdom (PHUK)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/PHUK-Main) : The section "Public Health in the United Kingdom" is a comprehensive study of how UK has implemented disease prevention, health promotion, reducing inequalities, and delivering comprehensive healthcare through the NHS (National Health Services).

- [**Simulated Research (SR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/SR-Main) : In simulated research, we create realistic scenarios to practice research without involving real subjects and real data. We develop complete research proposals, including design, data collection plans, and data analysis strategies, using simulated data. Hypothetical or past real-world cases are used to illustrate the research process and methodologies. This approach allows us to learn and practice how to conduct real research without involving people and actual data.

## English Communication
