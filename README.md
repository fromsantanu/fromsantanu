# Hi, I'm Santanu Karmakar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology specialist interested in Health Data Science. I love working on projects related to Epidemiology and Bio Statistics. Presently I teach Python and Java programming language. I also mentor my students do develop programs for various projects and professionally prepare for facing the real responsibilities.

## Key Project Categories
- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/EDA-Main) : It consists of python scripts of exploratory data analysis on various examples like disease and health infrastructure.
- [Statistical Methods (STM)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : This category includes problems of descriptive, Inferential statistics and probability distrbutions.
- [Data engineering (DEM)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : These will be a collection of python and SQL scripts extraction, scrapping, cleaning, transfomation and validation of data.
- [Geospatial Analysis of Disease Spread(GADS)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Analyze and visualize the geographic distribution of diseases using GIS tools and dealing with maps and coordinates.
- [Infectious Disease Modeling(IDM)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : It will include python scripts for different disease tracking models like SIR, SIER, SIS etc. with examples of disease like Covid, Dengue, TB etc.
- [Non-infectious Disease Modeling(NIDM)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Develop Agent-Based Models to understand the spread of diseases in a population by simulating the interactions of individuals.
- [Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning(PAML)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Use machine learning models to predict the likelihood of disease outbreaks based on historical and environmental data.
- [Behavioral Health Analytics(BHA)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Explore the impact of behavioral factors such as smoking, diet, sleep, exercise and stress on health outcomes.
- [Modeling Health Behavior Changes(MHBC)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Develop models to predict or influence changes in social relationships and interpesonal behaviors within populations.
- [Health Informatics and Data Integration(HIDI)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Analysing, Designing and Developing tools to process EHR data for insights into patient care and outcomes.
- [Bio-Statistical Analysis(BSA)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Implementing Time-Series Analysis, Clinical Trial Data Analysis, Survival Analysis, Causal Analysis etc using Python and R.
- [Data Warehousing and Intelligence(DWI)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/tbd) : Implement data integration and warehousing solutions to consolidate health data from various sources.
