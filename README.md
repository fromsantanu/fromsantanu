I'm a technology specialist interested in Health Data Science. These repositories have been created primarily for those who want to learn subjects associated with health data science. **We particularly aim to teach methods for researching, analyzing, and concluding on various problems related to healthcare practice**. Our main focus lies in the processes of **interpreting data, analyzing charts, drawing statistical inferences, and learning to make informed decisions**. Additionally, we want to explore methods of prediction. Therefore, we have organized the content into three categories:

- **Foundational Knowledge**: This category deals with foundational knowledge like Python, R, SQL, etc.
- **Case Studies on Healthcare and Epidemiology**: In this category, solutions exists that answer specific questions related to health datascience.
- **Research Analysis and Reviews**: This section reviews existing researches and reports. Here we do our own analysis with data extracted from real sources.


## Key Categories

### Foundational Knowledge

- [**Basic Python Programming (BPP)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BPP-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000):  The scope includes basic Python techniques for using the Python language. Additionally, there are many packages that are used for different purpose. We have covered commonly used packages like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and others that are useful in this context.
- [**Basic R Programming (BRP)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BRP-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000):  The scope includes basic R programming with the intention of solving statistical problems. There are two main sections. The first part covers basic R knowledge to solve statistical problems, while the second part focuses on the use of prominent packages commonly used in R.
- [**Introduction to Research Methods (IRM)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/IRM-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): Here, we have tried to include sections on common research methods related to the healthcare domain. Healthcare heavily depends on new findings contributed by research and studies on existing methods of treatment and their efficacies. Hence, we consider the ability to conduct research to be fundamental to healthcare studies.
- [**Basic Statistics for Research (BSR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BSR-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): In this section we have covered the basic techniques of statistics relevant to research and investigation. Please note we have not gone into the theoretical part, rather we focused on their fitment in different situations and various ways they can be performed using Python and R programming language both.
<!--

- [**Basic SQL concept Understanding (BSU)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BSU-Main) :  The section covers basic MySQL knowledge with standard SQL techniques that are commonly required to store and retrieve data.
-->

### Case Studies on Healthcare and Epideiology
- [**Cases of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/EDA-Main) : Includes basic charting methods like line chart, bar chart, histogram, pie chart and scatter charts. It also include the methods of data cleaning and preparation etc.
- [**Uses of Descriptive Statistics (DST)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/DST-Main) : The scope includes application of mean, medean and mode, varience, covarience, standard deviation, and concept of quartiles and quantiles.
- [**Application of Inferential Statistics (IST)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/IST-Main) : The scope include advanced charting with probaility distributions, hypothesis tesing, regression options, ANOVA testing etc. 
<!--

- [Infectious Disease Modeling (IDM) (Comming soon) (Currently disabled)](#) : It will include python scripts for different disease tracking models like SIR, SIER, SIS etc. with examples of disease like Covid, Dengue, TB etc.
- [Non-infectious Disease Modeling (NIDM) (Currently disabled)](#) : Develop Agent-Based Models to understand the spread of diseases in a population by simulating the interactions of individuals.
- [Bio-Statistical Analysis (BSA) (Currently disabled)](#) : Implementing Time-Series Analysis, Clinical Trial Data Analysis, Survival Analysis, Causal Analysis etc using Python and R.
- [Machine Learning and Neural Network (MLNN) (Currently disabled)](#) : Implementing machine learning and neural network to analyze and predict different situations related to health and disease.
- [Data engineering (DEM) (Currently disabled)](#) : These will be a collection of python and SQL scripts extraction, scrapping, cleaning, transfomation and validation of data.
-->
### Research Analysis and Reviews

- [**Topic Research (TR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/TR-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): Topic research involves gathering and synthesizing information on a specific subject (or a topic). It is typically a preliminary stage in research aimed at understanding the breadth and depth of a topic.
- [**Research Analysis (RA)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/RA-Main) : This section will contain analysis and explanation of single chosen research paper on a health related topic. The objective is to make things simpler to understand through easier explanations.
- [**Literature Review (LR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LR-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): A literature review is a comprehensive survey of existing literature on a specific topic. It involves summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing previous research.
- [**Simulated Research (SR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/SR-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): In simulated research, we create realistic scenarios to practice research without involving real subjects and real data. We develop complete research proposals, including design, data collection plans, and data analysis strategies, using simulated data. Hypothetical or past real-world cases are used to illustrate the research process and methodologies. This approach allows us to learn and practice how to conduct real research without involving people and actual data.
