# Hi, I'm Santanu Karmakar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology specialist interested in Health Data Science. I love working on projects related to Epidemiology and Bio Statistics. Presently I teach Python and Java programming language. I also mentor my students do develop programs for various projects and professionally prepare for facing the real responsibilities.
