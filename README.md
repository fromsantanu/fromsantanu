# Hi, I'm Santanu Karmakar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology specialist interested in Health Data Science. These repositories have been created mainly for those who want to learn subjects associated with health data science. Here, we have three categories:

- **Foundational Knowledge**: This category deals with foundational knowledge like Python, R, SQL, etc.
- **Domain-Specific Methods and Techniques**: In this category, solutions exists that answer specific questions related to health datascience.
- **Research analysis and reviews**: This section reviews existing researches and reports. Here we do our own analysis with data extracted from real sources.

### Research analysis and reviews

- [Topic Research (TR)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/TR-Main) : Topic research involves gathering and synthesizing information on a specific subject(or a topic). It is typically a preliminary stage in research aimed at understanding the breadth and depth of a topic.
- [Research Analysis (RA)](https://github.com/fromsantanu/RA-Main) : This section will contain analysis and explanation of single existing research paper on on a healthe related topic.
- [Literature Review (LR](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LR-Main) : A literature review is a comprehensive survey of existing literature on a specific topic. It involves summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing previous research.
