# Hi, I'm Santanu Karmakar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology specialist interested in Health Data Science. **These repositories have been created mainly for those who want to learn subjects associated with health data science**. We specially intend to learn the method of researching, analysing and concluding on various problems that are related to healthcare practice. Our main focus lies on the process of interpreting data, charts and statistical inferences and take decisions. We also want to explore methods of prediction. Thus, here we have three categories:

- **Foundational Knowledge**: This category deals with foundational knowledge like Python, R, SQL, etc.
- **Domain-Specific Methods and Techniques**: In this category, solutions exists that answer specific questions related to health datascience.
- **Research Analysis and Reviews**: This section reviews existing researches and reports. Here we do our own analysis with data extracted from real sources.


## Key Categories

### Foundational Knowledge

- [**Basic Python Programming (BPP)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BPP-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000):  The scope includes Basic Python Techniques for using Python language. Additionally we also cover the commonly used packages like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and others which are useful in this context.
- [**Basic R Programming (BRP)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BRP-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000):  The scope includes basic R programming with an intention to solve statistical problem solving. There are two main sections. First part covers basic R knowledge to solve statistics and second part mainly focuses on the use of prominant packages that are commonly used in R.
<!--

- [**Basic SQL concept Understanding (BSU)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/BSU-Main) :  The section covers basic MySQL knowledge with standard SQL techniques that are commonly required to store and retrieve data.
-->

### Domain Specific Methods & Techniques
- [**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/EDA-Main) : Includes basic charting methods like line chart, bar chart, histogram, pie chart and scatter charts. It also include the methods of data cleaning and preparation etc.
- [**Descriptive Statistics (DST)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/DST-Main) : The scope includes application of mean, medean and mode, varience, covarience, standard deviation, and concept of quartiles and quantiles.
- [**Inferential Statistics (IST)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/IST-Main) : The scope include advanced charting with probaility distributions, hypothesis tesing, regression options, ANOVA testing etc. 
<!--

- [Infectious Disease Modeling (IDM) (Comming soon) (Currently disabled)](#) : It will include python scripts for different disease tracking models like SIR, SIER, SIS etc. with examples of disease like Covid, Dengue, TB etc.
- [Non-infectious Disease Modeling (NIDM) (Currently disabled)](#) : Develop Agent-Based Models to understand the spread of diseases in a population by simulating the interactions of individuals.
- [Bio-Statistical Analysis (BSA) (Currently disabled)](#) : Implementing Time-Series Analysis, Clinical Trial Data Analysis, Survival Analysis, Causal Analysis etc using Python and R.
- [Machine Learning and Neural Network (MLNN) (Currently disabled)](#) : Implementing machine learning and neural network to analyze and predict different situations related to health and disease.
- [Data engineering (DEM) (Currently disabled)](#) : These will be a collection of python and SQL scripts extraction, scrapping, cleaning, transfomation and validation of data.
-->
### Research Analysis and Reviews

- [**Topic Research (TR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/TR-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): Topic research involves gathering and synthesizing information on a specific subject (or a topic). It is typically a preliminary stage in research aimed at understanding the breadth and depth of a topic.
- [**Research Analysis (RA)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/RA-Main) : This section will contain analysis and explanation of single chosen research paper on a health related topic. The objective is to make things simpler to understand through easier explanations.
- [**Literature Review (LR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LR-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): A literature review is a comprehensive survey of existing literature on a specific topic. It involves summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing previous research.
- [**Simulated Research (SR)**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/SR-Main) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/In%20Progress-008000): In simulated research we create realistic scenarios to practice research without involving real subjects and real data. In this we develop complete research proposals, including design, data collection plans, and data analysis strategies, using simulated data. We use hypothetical or past real-world cases to illustrate the research process and methodologies. It is just a way to learn and practice how to conduct a real research without involving people and data.
